# Face Recognition using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a face recognition system using machine learning techniques. It utilizes the "Labeled Faces in the Wild" (LFW) dataset and applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature reduction, followed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for face classification.

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the LFW dataset
- Displays sample images from the dataset
- Applies PCA for dimensionality reduction
- Trains an SVM classifier with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Evaluates model performance on test data



## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the face recognition pipeline step by step. The key sections include:
1. Data Loading: Fetching the LFW dataset.
2. Data Visualization: Displaying sample images.
3. Preprocessing: Applying PCA for feature extraction.
4. Model Training: Using SVM for classification.
5. Model Evaluation: Measuring accuracy and performance.

## Results
The model is trained and evaluated using a train-test split. The classification results are analyzed to determine accuracy and performance.
